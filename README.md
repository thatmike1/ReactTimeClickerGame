# React Time Clicker Game

This is a simple game built with React. The game challenges players to estimate the passage of time. The player starts a timer and tries to stop it as close as possible to a target time. The closer the player is to the target time, the higher their score.
## Game Components

### The game consists of 3 components:
- `Player`: This component allows the player to set their name.
- `TimerChallenge`: This component represents a single challenge or level in the game. Each challenge has a different target time.
- `ResultModal`: This component displays the result of a challenge, including the player's score.
## How to Play

1. Enter your name in the Player input field and click Set Name.
2. Click Start on a TimerChallenge to start the timer.
3. Click Stop when you estimate the target time has passed.
4. The ResultModal will display your score for the challenge.
